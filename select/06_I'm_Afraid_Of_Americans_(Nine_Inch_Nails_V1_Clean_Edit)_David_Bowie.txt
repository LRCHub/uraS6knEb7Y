Ah ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
Johnny's in America
Low techs at the wheel
(Ah ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
Nobody needs anyone
They don't even just pretend
(Ah ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
Johnny's in America

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

Johnny's in America
(Ah ah ah ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah)
Johnny wants a brain
Johnny wants to suck on a Coke
Johnny wants a woman
Johnny wants to think of a joke
(Ah ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
Johnny's in America
(Ah ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

(Ah ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)

Johnny's in America
Johnny looks up at the stars
Johnny combs his hair
And Johnny wants pussy and cars

Johnny's in America
(Ah ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
Johnny's in America
(Ah ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world

I'm afraid I can't

I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the world
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans

God is an American

Yeah, I'm afraid of Americans
I'm afraid of the words
I'm afraid I can't help it
I'm afraid I can't
I'm afraid of Americans
